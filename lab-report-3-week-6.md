# Lab Report 3 - Week 6

## Copying Whole Directories With `scp -r`

In this week's report, I go through the process and steps of copying entire directories into a remote connection from a local machine. This helps make the programming process and running the code on a remote connection much simpler and more efficient. The main command we'll use is the `scp -r` in the command line, which will copy recursively, from the directory to the files and directories inside it, and so on.

Throughout the report, I use a the GitHub repository, markdown-parse, to copy to the remote connection and run it on the server side. The link to the repository I use can be found here: [Link to repo](https://github.com/nathansng/markdown-parse).
