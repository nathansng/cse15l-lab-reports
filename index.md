### Lab Report 1

**Using Remote Access**

*Published January 14, 2022*

The first lab report goes through the steps to set up and use a remote connection to run Java files. It includes the steps I took to set up my course specific server account and how to use the login to access the remote connection. I also go through several common commands to use on the command line to manipulate files and directories on the remote server. After copying over different files from my local device to the server, I also come up with time efficient ways to copy over a Java file, compile, and run the file on the server.

In the second lab report, I go through the debugging process of finding and fixing errors in a piece of code given failed input tests. The report includes the steps I took to find the symptoms based on failure inducing input, as well as searching and fixing the bug causing the symptom in the code. There are three different examples of unexpected or failing outputs based on different failure inducing inputs. I use the markdown-parse project as the code to debug and practice running JUnit tests on the function defined in the repository.
