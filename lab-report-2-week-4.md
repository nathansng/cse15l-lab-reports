# Lab Report 2 - Week 4

## Debugging Code

This week's report goes through the process of how to debug code and identifying the different aspects of a bug, such as failure-inducing input, bugs, and symptoms. I go through some symptoms I observed when running the code and how I approach fixing the issues.

The code I use in this report is MarkdownParse, which is a Java class containing a function that is meant to extract the url of links in markdown files. While the function works on certain test cases, there are many issues with the code that this report seeks to find and fix. The original repository for MarkdownParse can be found on jpolitz's GitHub account (CSE 15L Professor). The link to the markdown parse repo can be found here: [markdown-parse repo](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w22/markdown-parse).
