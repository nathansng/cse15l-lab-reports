# Lab Report 2 - Week 4

## Debugging Code

This week's report goes through the process of how to debug code and identifying the different aspects of a bug, such as failure-inducing input, bugs, and symptoms. I have included examples from other students, as well as myself, that demonstrate different ways to deal with a bug in your code.
