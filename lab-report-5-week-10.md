# Lab Report 5 - Week

## Comparing Implementations and Outputs of MarkdownParse

In this week's report, I test my implementation of MarkdownParse against a given implementation of MarkdownParse on several more extensive tests compared to lab report 4. Instead of running each test independently or having to program individual JUnit tests for each file, I use a bash script and a function that allows me to run the implemenation on several files at once.

The MarkdownParse implementations I use can be found in the links below:

- Nathan's markdown-parse: [https://github.com/nathansng/markdown-parse](https://github.com/nathansng/markdown-parse)
- ucsd-cse15l-w22's markdown-parse: [https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w22/markdown-parse](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w22/markdown-parse)
